    <h1>Hello World, this is my story</h1>
    <p>I'm a little late in the game, but I'm excited to finally get started in the tech industry.  I worked on offshore oil platforms for 12+ years and finally decided I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in that industry. So I did what any normal person would do in that situation which was.... </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sold my house</li>
        <li>Bought a sailboat</li>
        <li>Moved onto the sailboat</li>
        <li>Quit my good paying job to become a pirate</li>
        <li>Drank and gambled for a year</li>
        <li>Realized I wasn't good at being a pirate</li>
        <li>Joined the tech revolution</li>
    </ol>
